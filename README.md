## Kill bill go client library
Kill bill go client library is a go package that can be used to connect to Kill Bill server.

### Install
```bash
go get -u github.com/killbill/kbcli/v3
```

### Creating new client
```go
    trp := httptransport.New("127.0.0.1:8080", "", nil)
    // Add text/xml producer which is not handled by openapi runtime.
    trp.Producers["text/xml"] = runtime.TextProducer()
    // Set this to true to dump http messages
    trp.Debug = false
    // Authentication
    authWriter := runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriterFunc(func(r runtime.ClientRequest, _ strfmt.Registry) error {
        encoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte("admin"/*username*/ + ":" + "password" /**password*/))
        if err := r.SetHeaderParam("Authorization", "Basic "+encoded); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        if err := r.SetHeaderParam("X-KillBill-ApiKey", apiKey); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        if err := r.SetHeaderParam("X-KillBill-ApiSecret", apiSecret); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return nil
    })
    client := kbclient.New(trp, strfmt.Default, authWriter, kbclient.KillbillDefaults{})
```

Look at the [complete example here](examples/listaccounts/main.go).
For more examples, look at [kbcmd tool](kbcmd/README.md).

### Wrapper client

We also provide a client wrapper (a higher level and easier to use api) that is built (not generated) on top of the generated code.
See the package `killbill` package under the `wrapper` directory.

There is a suite of test `client_test.go` that shows how to use it.

### Client code generation

We use a forked version of the `go-swagger` client hosted under https://github.com/killbill/go-swagger.
Every so often we rebase our fork from upstream to keep it up-to-date. Given a version of a `swagger` binary, the
client can be regenarated using:

`swagger  generate client -f kbswagger.yaml -m kbmodel -c kbclient --default-scheme=http`


### Generating dev extensions
The original project proposed separating out the clock test API but this is moved to always be available since Kill Bill will return an error when it's not in test mode. The API, however, is always available.

## Kill bill command line tool (kbcmd)
kbcmd is a command line tool that uses the go client library. This tool can do many of the
kill bill operations. More details are [available here in README](kbcmd/README.md).
